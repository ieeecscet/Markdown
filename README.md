[![logo](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/logo/image?id=13359&changeddate=1415798995770)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiLloKi3dThAhXadn0KHeAMC7YQFjACegQIDRAK&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMarkdown&usg=AOvVaw29vUwtb3gVG6rhYhCaDfbr)
## Understanding of a concept begins from the definition of that concept
>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)..
                                                            ![](http://d3g9pb5nvr3u7.cloudfront.net/authors/530f8d77a968b97107b613f5/1383334665/256.png)
                                                            As said by John Gruber
                                                            Co-Founder of Markdown.
Markdown can be written in a basic text editor (don't use Word) like TextEdit for Mac (save as plain-text) or Notepad on Windows. It's an easy way to write text that easily translates into HTML. The web is written in HTML, so think of it like quick-start web development tool for content editors. When you write in Markdown, you save the document with the file extension .md. More often than not, you'll never need to save a Markdown document, because you'll be using an online tool.

When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?

The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.

Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.
![workflow](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/75cdd78aba218a9abbfe91d2ba2cf540a7502d8c/553fa/assets/images/process.png)
### Well that was pretty simple,but why do we really need markdown?
Writers and publishers know the value of “flow” and how writing without distractions can help put thoughts into words efficiently. Picking up the mouse, selecting the text, hovering the mouse over to the bold icon and coming back to the keyboard, all end up disrupting the creative flow and create a disjointed experience. When you are “in the zone,” small interruptions like these can put off your writing.

Markdown gets rid of all the distractions of a formatting toolbar and mouse clicks by helping you focus on your writing without lifting your fingers off of the keyboard. Advanced writers love this kind of seamless experience which allows them to stylize their text on the fly.

 You could argue that clicking on the “bold” button is easier than writing a bunch of special characters, and for the most part, you are right. For an average user, Markdown may not seem to be as useful as it claims to be. However, the real magic appears when you get a hold of it. When you get past the slight learning curve, writing becomes that much faster and easier. You might never want to see a toolbar ever again.
 
Since Markdown is just plain text, it can be exported to a variety of applications and can be converted into a bunch of formats like PDF, epub, Docx, HTML, etc. You don’t need to worry about formatting, just start writing and export your document once you are done.

Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.

It doesn't take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write using Markdown just about everywhere. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.

Here are some examples of what you can do with Markdown.

### Websites

Markdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for creating website content.

If you're looking for the simplest possible way to create a website with Markdown files, check out [blot.im](https://blot.im) and [smallvictori.es](https://smallvictori.es). After you sign up for one of these services, they create a Dropbox folder on your computer. Just drag and drop your Markdown files into the folder and — poof! — they're on your website. It couldn't be easier.

If you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a popular static site generator that takes Markdown files and builds an HTML website. One advantage to this approach is that [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites. If Jekyll isn't your cup of tea, just pick one of the [many other static site generators available](https://www.staticgen.com/).


If you'd like to use a content management system (CMS) to power your website, take a look at [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). It's a free and open-source blogging platform with a nice Markdown editor. If you're a WordPress user, you'll be happy to know there's [Markdown support](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown/) for websites hosted on WordPress.com. Self-hosted WordPress sites can use the [Jetpack plugin](https://jetpack.com/support/markdown/).

### Documents

Markdown doesn't have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word, but it's good enough for creating basic documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown document authoring application to create and export Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do anything with it — print it, email it, or upload it to a website.

### Notes

In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes. Sadly, [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and [OneNote](http://www.onenote.com/), two of the most popular note applications, don't currently support Markdown. The good news is that several other note applications *do* support Markdown:

- **[Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/)** is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.
- **[Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/)** is an Evernote-like application available for Mac and iOS devices. It doesn't exclusively use Markdown syntax by default, but you can enable [Markdown compatibility mode](http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/Markup%20:%20Markdown/Markdown%20compatibility%20mode/).
- **[Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/)** bills itself as an "open source note-taking app designed for programmers."

If you can't part with Evernote, check out [Marxico](https://marxi.co/), a subscription-based Markdown editor for Evernote, or use [Markdown Here](http://markdown-here.com/features.html#not-just-email) with the Evernote website.

### Books

Looking to self-publish a novel? Try [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/), a service that takes your Markdown-formatted files and turns them into an electronic book. Leanpub outputs your book in PDF, EPUB, and MOBI file format. If you'd like to create paperback copies of your book, you can upload the PDF file to another service such as [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com) or [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com/). To learn more about writing and self-publishing a book using Markdown, read [this blog post](https://medium.com/techspiration-ideas-making-it-happen/how-i-wrote-and-published-my-novel-using-only-open-source-tools-5cdfbd7c00ca).

### Presentations

Believe it or not, you can generate presentations from Markdown-formatted files. Creating presentations in Markdown takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot faster and easier than using an application like PowerPoint or Keynote. [Remark](https://remarkjs.com) ([GitHub project](https://github.com/gnab/remark)) is a popular browser-based Markdown slideshow tool, as is [Cleaver](http://jdan.github.io/cleaver/) ([GitHub project](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver)). If you use a Mac and would prefer to use an application, check out [Deckset](https://www.decksetapp.com/) or  [Marked](http://marked2app.com/).

### Email

If you send a lot of email and you're tired of the formatting controls available on most email provider websites, you'll be happy to learn there's an easy way to write email messages using Markdown. [Markdown Here](http://markdown-here.com) is a free and open-source browser extension that converts Markdown-formatted text into HTML that's ready to send.

### Documentation

Markdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies like GitHub are increasingly switching to Markdown for their documentation — check out their [blog post](https://github.com/blog/1939-how-github-uses-github-to-document-github) about how they migrated their Markdown-formatted documentation to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you write documentation for a product or service, take a look at these handy tools:

- **[Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org)** can generate a documentation website from your open source Markdown files. Just connect your GitHub repository to their service and push — Read the Docs does the rest. They also have a [service for commercial entities](https://readthedocs.com/).
- **[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/)** is a fast and simple static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown and configured with a single YAML configuration file. MkDocs has several [built in themes](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/styling-your-docs/), including a port of the [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) documentation theme for use with MkDocs. One of the newest themes is [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
- **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)** is a static site generator designed exclusively for creating documentation websites. It supports translations, search, and versioning.
- **[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)** is a static site generator powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and optimized for writing technical documentation.
- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)** was mentioned earlier in the section on websites, but it's also a good option for generating a documentation website from Markdown files. If you go this route, be sure to check out the [Jekyll documentation theme](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).



## Tools you need or probably don't
Most of you are using VsCode and it has inbuilt markdown functionality.For more info on this go [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiuwsPp4dThAhUJvo8KHee7DqYQFjAAegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcode.visualstudio.com%2Fdocs%2Flanguages%2Fmarkdown&usg=AOvVaw3NgA89NiPOyA3JKf7DYaxq)
And for those of you using Sublime Text there are 2 plugins which will be helpful-->MarkdownEditor and MarkdownLivePreview.

You don’t even need to download anything. There are several online Markdown editors that you can use to try writing in Markdown. Dillinger is one of the best online Markdown editors. Just open the site and start typing in the left pane. A preview of the rendered document appears in the right pane.[Dillinger](https://dillinger.io)



!!BELOW ARE SOME TOOLS FOR PURE MARKDOWN AND ARE NOT NECESSARY UNLESS YOU ARE WRITING CONTENT PURELY IN MARKDOWN!!

- ReText for linux users [get it here](http://sourceforge.net/p/retext/home/ReText/).
- Mou for Mac users but if you have updated to Mojave you gotta pay [get it here](http://mouapp.com/).
- Marked is a tool providing live preview as you write in any text editor.
 
## SYNTAX
We will be focusing mainly on GFM or Github Flavoured Markdown which is markdown but with added functionality from github.It's really all about looking it up multiple times in cheat sheets as and when you need it and eventually you'll be a pro at it
Some links to useful resources are:

  * [Main Documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
  * [Github's syntax sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

### Text in markdown
`It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.`
`**BOLD1** __BOLD2__ __*BOLD + ITALIC*__ `
~~~
# this is a h1 tag
## this is a h2 tag
### this is a h3 tag
#### this is a h4 tag
##### this is a h5 tag
###### this is a h6 tag
~~~


It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.
**BOLD** __BOLD2__ __*BOLD + ITALIC*__ 

# this is a h1 tag
## this is a h2 tag
### this is a h3 tag
#### this is a h4 tag
##### this is a h5 tag
###### this is a h6 tag

#### Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

#### Blockquotes
~~~
>Markdown is cool and you who is trying to master it is cooler
Begin the second level of blockquotes
>
>>Me
>
End the second level of blockquotes
~~~

>Markdown is cool and you who is trying to master it is cooler
>
>>Me
>

You can use an Horizontal line easily like this
`* * *` or `***` which will result in

***

To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (`\`) in front of the character.

```
\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

\* Without the backslash, this would be a bullet in an unordered list.

### Characters You Can Escape

You can use a backslash to escape the following characters.

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>\</code></td>

    <tr>
      <td><code>`</code></td>
      <td>tick mark</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>*</code></td>
    <td>asterisk</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>_</code></td>
    <td>underscore</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>{}</code></td>
    <td>curly braces</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>[]</code></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>!</code></td>
    <td>exclamation mark</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### LISTS

~~~
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

#### CODE IN MARKDOWN

This is where Github flavoured markdown really comes into play.Syntax highlighitng for multiple languages and is really easy to implement.

Inline code is written by enclosing in backticks.
Multi line code is enclosed by ```
~~~
```language name
code
``` 
~~~
for syntax highlighting

![code](https://github.com/ieeecscet/Markdown/blob/master/Screenshot%202019-04-16%20at%2010.40.04%20PM.png)

Markdown and `print('code')` go hand in hand

```
x=[a for a in x if a>1]
for i in x:
    if i<1:
        print("Python doesn't work")
```

```python
x=[a for a in x if a>1]
for i in x:
    if i<1:
        print("Python doesn't work")
```

#### Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

![code](https://github.com/ieeecscet/Markdown/blob/master/Screenshot%202019-04-16%20at%2010.58.58%20PM.png)

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

#### Images

We can get cool images like this one using the syntax
`![alternate txt](url)`

![cool](https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/matrix-code.jpg?w=780)

#### Links

We can have inline links like this-> `hello this is an [example link](http://example.com)`

## hello this is an [example link](http://example.com)

We can also have images as links as we can see from this example where the illuminati symbol leads us to the wiki page of the illuminati.
The syntax is:
`[![alt txt](url)](link url)`

#### EXTRAS

GitHub supports emoji so go crazy
### :+1: :sparkles: :camel: :tada:
### :rocket: :metal: :octocat:

[THIS IS THE EMOJI CHEAT SHEET](www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com)

Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization

#### Task Lists

This is how you make task lists

![code](https://github.com/ieeecscet/Markdown/blob/master/Screenshot%202019-04-16%20at%2011.38.18%20PM.png)


- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item

### Well hopefully you have been convinced that learning Markdown is useful and you have got a good idea as to how to use it.Happy coding!
